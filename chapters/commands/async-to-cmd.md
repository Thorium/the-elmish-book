# From `Async<'t>` to `Cmd<'t>`

In the previous section, we implemented a command that dispatches a message after a delay. A delay is one example of an asynchronous operation. In F# we usually encode these operations using `Async<'t>` expressions.

Instead of creating custom commands every time we use `Async<'t>`, we can try to abstract it away into generic commands that convert any `Async<'t>` to `Cmd<'t>`. Let's take the last example and put it in its own function, say `incrementDelayed()`:
```fsharp
let incrementDelayed() : Cmd<Msg> =
    let incrementDelayedCmd (dispatch: Msg -> unit) : unit =
        let delayedDispatch = async {
            do! Async.Sleep 1000
            dispatch Increment
        }

        Async.StartImmediate delayedDispatch

    Cmd.ofSub incrementDelayedCmd
```
There are two specific variables that were hardcoded in the function: the delay of 1000 milliseconds and the message `Increment` that will be dispatched. We can extract these into the parameters of the function:
```fsharp {highlight: [1]}
let incrementDelayed (delay: int) (msg: Msg) : Cmd<Msg> =
    let incrementDelayedCmd (dispatch: Msg -> unit) : unit =
        let delayedDispatch = async {
            do! Async.Sleep delay
            dispatch msg
        }

        Async.StartImmediate delayedDispatch

    Cmd.ofSub incrementDelayedCmd
```
Now the function shouldn't be called `incrementDelayed` anymore because the message is parameterized and isn't necessarily `Increment` anymore. Maybe `delayedMsg` is more appropriate?
```fsharp
let delayedMsg (delay: int) (msg: Msg) : Cmd<Msg> =
    let incrementDelayedCmd (dispatch: Msg -> unit) : unit =
        let delayedDispatch = async {
            do! Async.Sleep delay
            dispatch msg
        }

        Async.StartImmediate delayedDispatch

    Cmd.ofSub incrementDelayedCmd
```
Now it is a generic delay function that can be used in `update` like this:
```fsharp {highlight: [5]}
let update msg state =
    match msg with
    | Increment -> { state with Count = state.Count + 1 }, Cmd.none
    | Decrement -> { state with Count = state.Count - 1 }, Cmd.none
    | IncrementDelayed -> state, delayedMsg 1000 Increment
```
Much more readable like this. Now you could easily implement `DecrementDelayed` as well as follows:
```fsharp
let update msg state =
    match msg with
    | Increment -> { state with Count = state.Count + 1 }, Cmd.none
    | Decrement -> { state with Count = state.Count - 1 }, Cmd.none
    | IncrementDelayed -> state, delayedMsg 1000 Increment
    | DecrementDelayed -> state, delayedMsg 1000 Decrement
```
But we are not done yet, if you examine the function `delayedMsg` again you will notice that we are hardcoding some functionality: the `Async.Sleep` function itself
```fsharp {highlight: [4]}
let delayedMsg (delay: int) (msg: Msg) : Cmd<Msg> =
    let incrementDelayedCmd (dispatch: Msg -> unit) : unit =
        let delayedDispatch = async {
            do! Async.Sleep delay
            dispatch msg
        }

        Async.StartImmediate delayedDispatch

    Cmd.ofSub incrementDelayedCmd
```
The functionality of `Async.Sleep` can also be extracted into a parameter:
```fsharp {highlight: [4, 13]}
let delayedSleepMsg (sleep: Async<unit>) (msg: Msg) : Cmd<Msg> =
    let delayedCmd (dispatch: Msg -> unit) : unit =
        let delayedDispatch = async {
            do! sleep
            dispatch msg
        }

        Async.StartImmediate delayedDispatch

    Cmd.ofSub delayedCmd

let delayedMsg (delay: int) (msg: Msg) : Cmd<Msg> =
    delayedSleepMsg (Async.Sleep delay) msg
```
Here `delayedMsg` is rewritten in terms of another function `delayedSleepMsg`. That function takes two inputs of type `Async<unit>` and `Msg`, simply dispatching that `Msg` from the input parameter after `sleep` finishes.

Having two parameters of type `Async<unit>` and `Msg` being separate doesn't seem very useful. It is not generic enough that you can **reuse** it since your `Async` expressions usually are returning some value other than `unit`. In fact, in Elmish applications you would want your asynchronous operations to return `Msg`. That way when you convert them to `Cmd<Msg>`, that returned message is dispatched and processed further by the application.

Let us combine both parameters of `Async<unit>` and `Msg` into a single asynchronous expression `Async<Msg>`. While we are at it, we can also rename the function `delayedSleepMsg` into something more generic like `fromAsync` because we are effectively turning an `Async<Msg>` into `Cmd<Msg>`:
```fsharp
let fromAsync (operation: Async<Msg>) : Cmd<Msg> =
    let delayedCmd (dispatch: Msg -> unit) : unit =
        let delayedDispatch = async {
            let! msg = operation
            dispatch msg
        }

        Async.StartImmediate delayedDispatch

    Cmd.ofSub delayedCmd
```
There we have it! Now we can take any async operation that returns a *message* and turn it into a command, dispatching that message as a result of the async operation. The function `delayedMsg` can now be re-written in terms of `fromAsync`:
```fsharp
let delayedMsg (delay: int) (msg: Msg) : Cmd<Msg> =
    let delay = async {
        do! Async.Sleep delay
        return msg
    }

    fromAsync delay
```
### Making `fromAsync` a library function
We implemented `fromAsync` to take a concrete `Msg` type, if you had named your `Msg` something else like `Event` or `Message` then you would need to change the function signature as well. A better approach is to modify the function slightly and make it a *generic* function for some type `'msg` such that you could use it across your projects:
```fsharp
let fromAsync (operation: Async<'msg>) : Cmd<'msg> =
    let delayedCmd (dispatch: 'msg -> unit) : unit =
        let delayedDispatch = async {
            let! msg = operation
            dispatch msg
        }

        Async.StartImmediate delayedDispatch

    Cmd.ofSub delayedCmd
```
You could even add it as an extension of the existing `Cmd` module:
```fsharp
open Elmish

module Cmd =
    let fromAsync (operation: Async<'msg>) : Cmd<'msg> =
        let delayedCmd (dispatch: 'msg -> unit) : unit =
            let delayedDispatch = async {
                let! msg = operation
                dispatch msg
            }

            Async.StartImmediate delayedDispatch

        Cmd.ofSub delayedCmd
```
After you have added the function `fromAsync` as an extension of the `Cmd` module, you can use it in your `update` and `init` functions like other functions that are available in the `Cmd` module:
```fsharp {highlight: [11]}
let update msg state =
    match msg with
    | Increment -> { state with Count = state.Count + 1 }, Cmd.none
    | Decrement -> { state with Count = state.Count - 1 }, Cmd.none
    | IncrementDelayed ->
        let delayedIncrement = async {
            do! Async.Sleep 1000
            return Increment
        }

        state, Cmd.fromAsync delayedIncrement
```
