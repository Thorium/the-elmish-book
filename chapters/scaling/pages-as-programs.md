# Web Pages As Programs

When we talk about breaking down an Elmish program into smaller programs, we speak of these programs as the *logical compartments* of the main root program. In the context of a web application, these compartments would be represented by the different pages that make up that application.

In this chapter, we will learn how to implement multiple *pages* of a web application as separate programs.

You might have an application with a login page, after a user logs in, he or she is redirected to the administration page of your application which itself could be made out of multiple pages

<div style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom:40px;">
  <div style="margin: 0 auto; width:60%;">
    <resolved-image source="/images/scaling/example-app.png" />
  </div>
</div>

In the diagram above, every block represents a web page which is implemented as a separate program with its own state and events. Some of these web pages have nested pages in which case we speak the notion of a "parent" program (for example Admin) and "child" programs (Dashboard, Users and Settings) where each program is a web page.

<div style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom:40px;">
  <div style="margin: 0 auto; width:60%;">
    <resolved-image source="/images/scaling/parent-child.png" />
  </div>
</div>

> Admin is a child of the top-level root program.

Parent programs are special kinds of programs. They manage the state of their data and events but are also responsible for explicitly managing the data and events of their child programs. When a parent program primarily manages the state of its children (even if itself has some state) it can be reduced away: the parent state and the child programs move one level up. This helps reduce the complexity of the application as parent programs usually introduce some syntactic overhead. We will talk about this in great detail later on in the chapter.

<div style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom:40px;">
  <div style="margin: 0 auto; width:60%;">
    <resolved-image source="/images/scaling/simplified-app.png" />
  </div>
</div>

Even though the programs operate independently, they need to have a way to exchange data with the other programs (i.e., web pages). For example, while you are on the Dashboard page, you need to know the username of the user who is currently logged in to show it in the header of the page, but the information related to the user such as the username and current session is first obtained from the Login page after a user is able to successfully log in with proper credentials. This means that after logging in, the Login page should somehow *propagate* the user information to the dashboard. We will be looking at data communication between these programs in this chapter:

<div style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom:40px;">
  <div style="margin: 0 auto; width:60%;">
    <resolved-image source="/images/scaling/fable-pages-overview.png" />
  </div>
</div>

### What About Complex Pages

What do we do when a web page has really complex<sup>*</sup> parts and these parts aren't necessarily nested pages? You might say, let's break up that page again in smaller programs and have the page manage these parts like a parent program. That would be one solution. However, as mentioned before, introducing a parent program itself increases the complexity of the page because of the overhead of having to communicate the data between the different parts as opposed to having the data in one place as a single program.

Unfortunately, the tipping-point is not really obvious as to where you should break down programs into smaller ones. It really depends on the concerns of said program and what you think of "too complex to be included in a single place". That is why we start with the *simple* and *concrete* form of separation: **different web pages implemented with separate programs** as a guideline for breaking down web applications.
