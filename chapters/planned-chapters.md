# Planned Chapters

As of the current state of the book, I hope to have covered the fundamental chapters of front-end web development with Elmish, Fable and webpack. Unfortunately, I was not able to cover all the subjects I had in mind when I started writing way back in November 2017 because otherwise I would be writing till 2030 and still not finished the content.

After the fundamentals, there are subjects I want to dive into and cover as separate chapters to do justice to the material. I will present the ideas I have in mind and we can discuss how I should prioritize which chapters get written first as needed by the community and how it makes sense as a whole from the point of view of the book.

Here are the chapters I have in mind. They are listed in no particular order. I might make a poll at some point and ask the F# community what to write first.

- **Writing Unit Tests** extends the project we have been working on to be able to write unit tests for Elmish programs, run them with live reloading during development and prepare them for CI server integration.

- **Full-Stack F# with SAFE** discusses how to build full-stack web applications entirely in F# following the tools combined in the [SAFE stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/)
- **Interop with JavaScript** covers advanced interop techniques in Fable that allow us to write F# code which generates custom JavaScript code and it able to talk to third-party JavaScript libraries.
- **Elmish Data Visualizations** is concerned with using charting and map libraries to visualize data in Elmish applications.
- **Elmish Desktop Applications** with [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) using Fable. Possibly covering [React-NodeGui](https://github.com/nodegui/react-nodegui) or [Avalonia.FuncUI](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Avalonia.FuncUI).
- **Elmish Mobile Development** with [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/) and Fable. Possibly covering [Fabulous](https://github.com/fsprojects/Fabulous) with Xamarin Forms.
